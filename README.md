# A tampermonkey script to create a split view, built for surface duo

It allows you to view a page on the right side while keeping the source on the left.  
It breaks the original behavior of links to make it possiable to navigate.  
It also uses sandbox to counteract anti-attack behavior of some websites.  
In all, it is a primitive and rough way that may have many unknown problems.
